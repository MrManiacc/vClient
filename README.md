## Vizun

Vizun (Pronounced _vision_) is an open source video game project. We are hoping to meet the goals of
the project as well as educate people, especially young people, on the many different types of code through
our encouragement for our end users to contribute to the open source project workflow in some way or another.

Visit us on our [Official Website](http://vizun.org) for project updates, information, forums and more!

### Issues
If you find issues, please report them on our [issue tracker](http://bugs.vizun.org).

#### Contribute
We are an open source project! We encourage, welcome, and _need_ your contributions. If you can't contribute
then another part of the open source workflow is to have our users submitting bug reports, etc. We welcome any
kind of contribution. If you would like to help with the code, please note that we are officially using _Gradle_
for building. Please take a look at some [more information](http://vizun.org/developer.php) regarding our Developer Team!
